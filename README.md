# Customer Churn Prediction Project ðŸŽ¯

## Developer: laysblue

This project implements a machine learning solution for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. The model helps identify customers who are likely to discontinue services, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. Data Preprocessing:
```bash
python src/preprocessing.py
```

2. Train Model:
```bash
python src/model.py
```

## Results
